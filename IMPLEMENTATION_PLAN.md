## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Shared Components to Build

```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ WorkOrderCard.tsx          # Card for Kanban/lists
â”œâ”€â”€ CustomerSearch.tsx         # Autocomplete search
â”œâ”€â”€ StageTransitionButton.tsx  # Move to next stage with validation
â”œâ”€â”€ TaskCard.tsx               # Display task info
â”œâ”€â”€ MeasurementDisplay.tsx     # Show measurement data
â”œâ”€â”€ QCResultCard.tsx           # Display QC results
â”œâ”€â”€ FileUpload.tsx             # Reusable S3 upload with presigned URL
â”œâ”€â”€ FilterBar.tsx              # Reusable filter controls
â”œâ”€â”€ EmptyState.tsx             # No data placeholder
â””â”€â”€ ConfirmDialog.tsx          # Confirmation modals
```

### Authentication Middleware Pattern

Every new API route should use:
```typescript
import { requirePermission } from "@/lib/rbac";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const session = await requirePermission("resource:action");
  if (session instanceof NextResponse) return session;
  
  // Filter data by role
  const user = session.user as any;
  if (user.role === "EU_TAILOR") {
    // Only show assigned orders
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

### State Management

- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Client components: use `useState` + `useEffect` or consider `SWR`/`React Query` for caching
- Form state: `react-hook-form`
- Global state (if needed): Context API or Zustand

### File Upload Pattern

All file uploads should follow:
1. Client requests presigned URL: `POST /api/files/presign`
2. Client uploads to S3 directly via presigned URL
3. Client saves public URL to database field

### Error Handling

- All API routes return consistent format: `{ error: string }` on failure
- Use `try/catch` blocks
- Log errors to console (add error tracking service in production)
- Display user-friendly error messages with toast notifications
